# MASTER PROMPT - NutriSense

> **How to use this file:** open this folder (`8.ProjectCode`) as its own workspace, start a new Claude Code session and say:
> *"Read MASTER_PROMPT.md completely and follow it exactly, starting with Phase 1."*
> Everything the session needs is inside this file.

## 0. Your role

You are the lead engineer and product designer for **NutriSense** - personalised Indian meal plans that hit your calorie and nutrient targets, respect allergies and health conditions, and adapt as you progress.

You will take it from this almost-empty folder to a complete, polished, fully working product.

**Scale:** build a complete product that runs end-to-end on a single Windows 10/11 machine and can be demonstrated live. Do **not** engineer for internet scale - no microservices, Kubernetes, message brokers, cloud deployment or load balancing. But **nothing may be fake**: every feature in section 4.4 must really work with real data, real models and real outputs.

---

## 1. Non-negotiable rules

1. **Plan -> Ask -> Build.** Do not write application code at the start. Complete Phase 1 (plan) and Phase 2 (requirements and guided setup) from section 10, then wait for the user's explicit **"proceed"** before building.
2. **Real product identity.** It must read, look and behave like a genuine product from a product company. Never write anywhere - code, comments, UI text, docs, README, sample data, file names, commit messages - anything suggesting it is coursework or was built for an institution: no "B.Tech", "final year", "major project", "mini project", "semester", "college project", "university project", "student batch", "project guide", "supervisor", "viva", "project review", "project submission", "HOD" or academic department names, and no names of people or institutions outside the product itself. Ordinary product words (for example a hospital department or a moderator review) are fine.
3. **Works end-to-end.** No placeholders, TODOs, dummy buttons, hard-coded fake results or "coming soon" screens. Seed/demo data is allowed only as clearly labelled sample data; every prediction must come from the real trained model or the real API.
4. **Stay on purpose.** Build exactly the product in section 4.4. Small polish is welcome; changing the product's stated purpose or core technique is not.
5. **Local Windows first.** One-command setup and start (`setup.bat`, `run.bat`). Docker is optional - use it only if a component genuinely needs it, and say why.
6. **Everything is committed** (section 14): code, notebooks, training logs, metrics, result plots, trained models, datasets (full or sample - section 8) and all docs. Only `venv/`, `node_modules/` and `.env` stay out.
7. **Secrets** live only in `.env` (git-ignored). Commit a complete `.env.example` listing every key with a comment on where to get it. Never hard-code keys.
8. **Ask, don't guess.** When anything outside the code is needed (keys, files, hardware, a decision), ask - and explain exactly how to get it, step by step, for a non-expert.
9. **Documentation is part of the product** (section 13).
10. **Leave `2.ABSTRACT.docx` in this folder untouched** and do not reference it anywhere in the product. Do not modify anything outside this folder except the final copy step in Phase 8.
11. **Fixed ports - other products may be running on this PC at the same time.** Backend API: **8211**. Frontend dev server: **5211**. Any extra local service (simulators, extra servers, test targets, worker UIs) uses a port in **12110-12119**. Put them in `.env` / `.env.example` and `vite.config.ts` (with `strictPort: true`); never use the defaults 8000 / 5173.

## 2. The problem

- Generic diet charts ignore individual needs and goals.
- People find it hard to plan balanced meals with busy lifestyles.
- Diet apps often ignore allergies and medical conditions.
- Professional nutrition advice is costly and less accessible.

**What is needed:** An AI-powered planner that generates safe, balanced and personalised meal plans and tracks progress.

---

## 3. Who uses it

- People managing weight and everyday health
- People with diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol
- Families planning meals together

---

## 4. System evolution - understand this before designing

### 4.1 Reference system (published research this product builds on)

**Artificial intelligence in personalized nutrition and food manufacturing: a comprehensive review of methods, applications, and future directions** - Frontiers in Nutrition, 2025 - https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1636980

- A comprehensive review of AI in personalised nutrition and food manufacturing.
- Covers machine learning, deep learning, recommender systems and computer-vision food recognition applied to diet personalisation.
- Highlights future directions such as adaptive, data-driven meal recommendation.

### 4.2 Advanced system - the product specification (must be fully satisfied)

- Users create profiles with age, gender, height, weight, activity level, preferences and goals.
- The system calculates BMI, BMR and daily calorie requirements.
- AI generates balanced meal plans for weight loss, weight gain or maintenance.
- Recommendations respect dietary restrictions, allergies and medical conditions.
- Users track intake and progress through dashboards.

Objectives the product must meet:

1. Collect user profiles with health, activity and goal details.
2. Calculate daily calorie and nutrient requirements.
3. Generate personalised meal plans using AI.
4. Respect allergies, dietary restrictions and medical conditions.
5. Track nutritional intake and progress over time.
6. Provide an easy-to-use web interface.

### 4.3 Latest approaches (2025-2026 state of the art)

- Constraint optimisation (linear programming) that guarantees nutrient targets.
- LLM recipe generation with safety guardrails.
- Food photo recognition with multimodal models.
- Adaptive plans that recalibrate from progress data.

### 4.4 What you will build - NutriSense (the latest, advanced, innovative system)

This combines the specification in 4.2 with the improvements below. Items marked **NEW** go beyond the specification.

- **F1 Profile and goals** - age, gender, height, weight, activity, diet type (veg / egg / non-veg / vegan), regional cuisine, allergies, conditions, goal.
- **F2 Requirements** - BMI, BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor), TDEE, calorie target, macro split; condition rules (low glycaemic load for diabetes, sodium limit for hypertension, saturated-fat limit for cholesterol).
- **F3 Meal plan generator** - 7-day plan optimised with linear programming over Indian dishes to meet calories, macros, fibre and sodium with variety; allergens hard-blocked; Gemini adds recipe steps.
- **F4 Smart swaps** (NEW) - replace any dish with nutritionally similar alternatives.
- **F5 Food logging** - search dishes and portions; photo logging (NEW) where Gemini identifies the dish and portion for the user to confirm.
- **F6 Progress tracking** - weight log, intake vs target charts, adherence score; weekly adaptive recalibration (NEW).
- **F7 Grocery list** (NEW) - generated from the week's plan.
- **F8 Safety guardrails** - never below a safe calorie floor; condition limits; disclaimer.

---

## 5. Screens and user flows

1. Landing page
2. Login / register
3. Onboarding profile wizard
4. Dashboard (targets, today's intake, progress)
5. Weekly meal plan with swaps and recipes
6. Food log (search, photo)
7. Progress charts
8. Grocery list
9. Settings

Every screen needs loading, empty and error states, and must work on a phone-sized screen.

---

## 6. AI / ML components

- Local CPU: K-Means clustering of dishes by nutrient profile (for swaps); linear programming (PuLP) for plans.
- Evaluate: share of plans within +/-5% of targets, zero allergen violations across test profiles, photo-logging accuracy on a small labelled set.

Save for every trained model: the model file, a metrics JSON (with the dataset split and date), confusion matrix / curves as PNG, and the training log - all under `experiments/<run-name>/` - and show the key metrics inside the product (an "About the model" or "Model performance" view).

---

## 7. Tech stack (fixed - ask before changing anything)

**Frontend**
- React 18 + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix-based components) + Lucide icons
- React Router, TanStack Query (server state), Axios
- Motion (Framer Motion) for component/page transitions and micro-interactions
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven landing-page sequences
- Lenis for smooth scrolling (landing page)
- React Bits (reactbits.dev) components for premium text/background effects - copy the component source into src/components/reactbits/ (they are copy-paste components, not an npm package)
- Recharts for charts and analytics

**Backend**
- Python 3.11, FastAPI + Uvicorn, Pydantic v2
- SQLAlchemy 2.x with SQLite (single file under data/), created automatically on first run
- JWT authentication (PyJWT) with bcrypt password hashing (passlib)
- python-dotenv for configuration; structured logging; automatic OpenAPI docs at /docs
- pytest for backend tests

**Data / ML / AI**
- scikit-learn / XGBoost for classical ML; PyTorch (+ torchvision) for deep learning; joblib for model files
- Google Gemini API through the official google-genai Python SDK for LLM features. Model name comes from .env (GEMINI_MODEL); default to the newest free-tier 'Flash' model available when you build (check Google AI Studio).
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib (training plots saved as PNG)

**Specific to NutriSense**
- PuLP (CBC solver), Gemini (text and vision)
- USDA FoodData Central API (free key or DEMO_KEY) for ingredient lookups - key signup: https://api.data.gov/signup/

## 8. Data and datasets

- **Indian Food Nutritional Values Dataset (2025)** (Kaggle) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/batthulavinay/indian-food-nutrition - CC BY-SA 4.0 -> commit.
- **South Asian Recipes with Nutrition & Steps** (Kaggle) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsanneural/10k-south-asian-recipes-with-nutrition-and-steps - 9.8 MB, CC BY-SA 4.0 -> commit.
- **Nutritional & Carbon Footprint Data of Indian Diet** (Kaggle) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umangsinghal5/nutritional-and-carbon-footprint-data-of-indian-diet - CC BY 4.0 -> commit.

**Dataset rules**
- If a dataset's total size is about 200 MB or less and no single file is over 100 MB, **commit the complete dataset** under `data/raw/`.
- Otherwise commit a **representative sample** under `data/sample/` (enough for the app and tests to run) **plus** `scripts/download_data.py`, which downloads the full dataset (Kaggle datasets via `kagglehub`, which uses the user's Kaggle API token), verifies it and places it in `data/raw/` (git-ignored for the full copy).
- Document every dataset in `docs/04_DATASET.md`: source link, licence, size, columns/classes, how it was cleaned, what is committed, and a step-by-step download guide (including how to create a Kaggle API token).
- Any data you generate (synthetic or simulated) must come from a committed, seeded generator script so it can be re-created exactly.

---

## 9. What you must get from the user (ask in Phase 2)

1. Gemini API key - https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Optional: USDA FoodData Central key (guided).
3. Confirm the cuisines and conditions to support (defaults: North and South Indian; diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol).

For each item, give numbered, beginner-friendly steps (which website, which button, what to copy, where to paste it), then **wait** until the user confirms. Check that each key or file works before moving on.

---

## 10. Workflow - follow in this order

**Phase 1 - Understand and plan (no code yet)**
1. Read this whole file. Check the machine: Windows version, Python (3.11 preferred), Node.js (LTS), Git, free disk space. Tell the user what is missing and how to install it.
2. Write `docs/PLAN.md`: architecture (with a Mermaid diagram), module list mapped to features F1..Fn, database tables, API endpoints, ML pipeline, screens, milestones, risks.
3. Show the user a short summary of the plan and **stop**. Continue only after the user approves (they may ask for changes).

**Phase 2 - Requirements and guided setup**
1. Ask for every item in section 9, one group at a time, with step-by-step guidance.
   - **Model training runs locally** on this PC (CPU is enough): prepare `ml/train_*.py` scripts; they run in Phase 4.
2. Create `.env.example` and help the user fill `.env`. Test every key or connection with a tiny script and report the result.
3. Confirm everything is ready and wait for **"proceed"**.

**Phase 3 - Foundations**
Project skeleton (section 11), `setup.bat` and `run.bat`, backend app with database, auth and seed data, frontend app shell with routing, theme and layout. Commit and push.

**Phase 4 - Data and AI/ML**
Data scripts, preprocessing, training (locally, or loading the files trained on Kaggle), evaluation, experiment artefacts, inference service with tests. Commit and push.

**Phase 5 - Features**
Build features F1..Fn end-to-end (API + UI) in the order from the plan. Commit and push after each major feature.

**Phase 6 - Landing page and polish**
The animated landing page, micro-interactions, responsive fixes, accessibility pass, empty/error states. Commit and push.

**Phase 7 - Test end-to-end**
Run backend tests, a production build of the frontend, and walk through the demo scenario in section 15 yourself. Fix everything you find. Commit and push.

**Phase 8 - Documentation and hand-over**
Write all docs (section 13) and the README. Copy `docs/03_HOW_TO_RUN.md` to `../18.FinalCodeExecutionSteps/HOW_TO_RUN.md`. Final commit and push. Give the user a short summary: how to run it, the demo login, and what each part does.

```

---

## 12. Frontend design brief

- **Brand:** a clean logo (SVG), a colour palette that fits the product's field, light and dark themes, a consistent type scale.
- **Landing page:**
  - an animated hero (a React Bits text or background effect) with a clear one-line value proposition and a "Get started" call to action;
  - GSAP ScrollTrigger reveals for the "How it works" steps and the feature grid, with Lenis smooth scrolling;
  - Motion micro-interactions on cards and buttons, and a footer.
- **App:** login and register, a sidebar layout, a dashboard with KPI cards and Recharts charts, then the feature screens from section 5. Use toasts, skeleton loaders and confirmation dialogs.
- **Motion quality:** animations must be smooth and purposeful, never block the user, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Responsive:** everything must work from 360 px phone width up to desktop.

---

## 13. Documentation (`docs/`) and README

Write each document separately, clearly, for someone new to the product:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `docs/01_OVERVIEW.md` | What the product is, the problem, users, feature list |
| `docs/02_ARCHITECTURE.md` | How it works: architecture and data-flow diagrams (Mermaid), components, sequence of the main flows |
| `docs/03_HOW_TO_RUN.md` | Prerequisites, installation, `setup.bat` / `run.bat`, first login, stopping, resetting, running on a phone if relevant |
| `docs/04_DATASET.md` | Dataset sources, licences, schema, cleaning, what is committed, download guide |
| `docs/05_MODELS_AND_TRAINING.md` | Models, how they are trained (local steps / Kaggle notebook steps), settings, results tables, plots |
| `docs/06_API_REFERENCE.md` | Every endpoint with request and response examples |
| `docs/07_USER_GUIDE.md` | Screen-by-screen walkthrough of every feature |
| `docs/08_CONFIGURATION.md` | Every `.env` key, what it does and how to obtain it |
| `docs/09_TESTING.md` | Tests, how to run them, results, the demo scenario |
| `docs/10_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Common problems and fixes |
| `docs/11_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` | Folder-by-folder explanation of the code |

`README.md` in the root: product introduction, key features, quick start, demo login, and a **Documentation index for maintainers** linking every file above.

---

## 14. Git rules

Other Claude Code sessions may be building other products in sibling folders of the same repository **at the same time**. Touch only this folder.

- **Commit only this folder.** From this folder run `git add -A .` and then `git commit -m "<message>" -- .` - the `-- .` keeps anything other sessions have staged out of your commit. Never run a bare `git commit`.
- Commit messages: **3-5 plain words** (for example "Add login and dashboard"). No message body, no co-author or AI-attribution lines.
- The author identity is already configured in the repository - never change any git config.
- **Push** with `git push` after every commit. All sessions share one local branch, so it already contains everyone's commits and no pull is normally needed. If the push is rejected because the remote has newer commits, run `git pull --rebase --autostash` only when `git status` shows no changes outside this folder; otherwise wait a minute and try again, and ask the user if it keeps failing.
- If git reports `index.lock` or "another git process", another session is committing: wait 10 seconds and retry (up to 5 times). Never delete `.git/index.lock` yourself.
- **Never** run commands that change files outside this folder or rewrite history: no `git stash`, `git reset`, `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git clean`, `git rebase` (other than the pull above) and never `git push --force`.
- The one exception to "only this folder" is Phase 8: name `../18.FinalCodeExecutionSteps/HOW_TO_RUN.md` explicitly in both commands - `git add -A . ../18.FinalCodeExecutionSteps/HOW_TO_RUN.md` and `git commit -m "<message>" -- . ../18.FinalCodeExecutionSteps/HOW_TO_RUN.md`.
- `.gitignore` in this folder must exclude `venv/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `data/raw/` **only when** the full dataset is not being committed, and build output (`dist/`).
- A single file over 100 MB (for example a large model) needs Git LFS: ask the user first, then `git lfs track "<pattern>"` from this folder and commit the `.gitattributes` it creates here.

---

## 15. Definition of done

**Demo scenario - must run smoothly from a fresh `run.bat`:**
1. Create a profile: 28, vegetarian, peanut allergy, weight-loss goal -> 1,650 kcal target and macros.
2. Generate a week -> every day within target, no peanut dishes; swap a dish; view the recipe.
3. Log lunch by photo -> dish recognised, confirmed, intake chart updates.
4. Enter a week of weights -> plan recalibrates; grocery list generated.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Every feature F1..Fn works end-to-end through the UI.
- [ ] Every model, AI component or optimisation engine is evaluated; metrics are visible in the product and in `docs/05_MODELS_AND_TRAINING.md`.
- [ ] `setup.bat` and `run.bat` work on a fresh Windows machine following `docs/03_HOW_TO_RUN.md`.
- [ ] Backend tests pass; the frontend production build succeeds.
- [ ] No placeholder text, no academic wording, no hard-coded secrets.
- [ ] It runs on its own ports (8211 / 5211) while other products run on the same PC.
- [ ] All docs and the README are written, and `../18.FinalCodeExecutionSteps/HOW_TO_RUN.md` is copied.
- [ ] Everything is committed and pushed.
